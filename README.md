# MEANBoilerPlate
Seperate front and backend boiler plate for the mean stack.
To see latest changes check out the develop branch.

# Backend

Using gulp to run the server.js ('cd backend && gulp start') we allow access to our frontend and any other apps that would like to use our restful api.

# Frontend

Angular js modules makeup our app in the front end, its important to keep things self contained and modular. We run this app seperately with the cmd cd frontend && http-server .
